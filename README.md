## Description

My first computer science portfolio built using Blender and React Three Fiber, consisting of a badminton-themed scene centered around four hidden rooms inside a badminton cork. This project showcases my skills in 3D modeling, animation, and web development. The portfolio includes interactive elements, realistic physics, and immersive sound effects. This portfolio is currently in version 1 and I plan to add more features to it in the future. The best experience is on a tablet or a computer.

## Installation

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JaMussCraft/Portfolio-Three-JS.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Portfolio-Three-JS
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Running the Project

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Navigating the Project

- Find a "magic birdie" in each room to move onto the next room
- Use the arrow keys to navigate through unlocked rooms.
- Click on interactive elements to explore more details.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: For creating and displaying animated 3D graphics.
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **React Three Fiber**: For integrating Three.js with React.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application.
- **Vite**: For development and build processes.
- **GSAP**: For animations.
- **Leva**: For creating a GUI for tweaking parameters.
- **React Spring**: For animations in React.
- **React Three Rapier**: For physics simulations.
- **PostCSS**: For transforming styles with JS plugins.
- **Autoprefixer**: For parsing CSS and adding vendor prefixes.

## Rooms & Future Plans

- **Work Room**: Inspired by my bedroom. I plan to make the monitor, rubrix cube, and keyboard interactive. 
- **Play Room**: A corner of a badminton court. I plan to turn this into a mini-game playground or embed my 2D badminton game in here.
- **About-Me Room**: My ideal living room with everything about me, including my Malaysian heritage, interests in Anime and video games.
- **Contact Room**: Showcases personal projects and my contact information.
